# Exercise #1 
# What version of R are you using (hint: make sure you download the
# latest version and then type version)? Please note that this question
# does not count toward your grade, but it is important to make sure 
# that you are using the latest version of R. If the answer is not the
# MOST updated, please just let us know

# Exercise #2 
# Create a numeric vector containing the numbers 
# 2.23, 3.45, 1.87, 2.11, 7.33, 18.34, 19.23. 
# What is the average of these numbers?

# The cars dataset is available in base R. You can type cars to see it. 
# Use the class function to determine what type of object is cars.

# How many rows does the cars object have?

# Exercise #6
# What is the name of the second column of cars?

#--------------------------------------------------
# Exercise #7 
# The simplest way to extract the columns of a matrix or data.frame is using [.
# For example you can access the second column with cars[,2].
# What is the average distance traveled in this dataset? 
mean(cars[,2])

# Familiarize yourself with the which function. 
# What row of cars has a a distance of 85?
