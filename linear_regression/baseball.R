# The goal of a baseball game is to score more runs (points) than the other team.
# Each team has 9 batters who have an opportunity to hit a ball with a bat in a predetermined order. 
# Each time a batter has an opportunity to bat, we call it a plate appearance (PA).
# The PA ends with a binary outcome: the batter either makes an out (failure) and returns to the bench or the batter doesnâ€™t (success) and can run around the bases, and potentially score a run (reach all 4 bases).
# We are simplifying a bit, but there are five ways a batter can succeed (not make an out):
#   
# 1. Bases on balls (BB): the pitcher fails to throw the ball through a predefined area considered to be hittable (the strike zone), so the batter is permitted to go to first base.
# 2. Single: the batter hits the ball and gets to first base.
# 3. Double (2B): the batter hits the ball and gets to second base.
# 4. Triple (3B): the batter hits the ball and gets to third base.
# 5. Home Run (HR): the batter hits the ball and goes all the way home and scores a run.
# 
# Historically, the batting average has been considered the most important offensive statistic. To define this average, we define a hit (H) and an at bat (AB). Singles, doubles, triples and home runs are hits. The fifth way to be successful, a walk (BB), is not a hit. An AB is the number of times you either get a hit or make an out; BBs are excluded. The batting average is simply H/AB and is considered the main measure of a success rate.
